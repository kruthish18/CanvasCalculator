## Seventh assignment for INFO6150, where we are Building a Calculator Application using JavaScript canvas API
 
Calculator Application


A simple Calculator Application is developed as a part of this assignment. It is created using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The interface of the calculator is drawn using the Canvas.  The canvas element is used to draw the calculator's interface, which is then used to handle user input via mouse or touch events.



Usage
Simply click or tap on the buttons on the canvas to use the calculator and enter numbers and perform calculations.


Installation
To install and run the calculator, follow these steps:

1.Download the project files to your local machine.
2.Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
3.The calculator application should load automatically in the browser.


Note: Verify that JavaScript is enabled and that the JavaScript console is error-free. Otherwise, the calculator won't load or display correctly in your browser.
